Hello, <%=@name%>


You have been invited to participate at this event that will be happening 


Thanks for the booking. Attached is your invoice for your show in <%=@places%> <%= @timing %>. I require a 30% deposit now which you can pay by a number of 

methods online by logging into your account using your email address as your user name . I will email a receipt when 
the money comes through. The balance is due 30 days prior to the show which you can pay anytime the same way.


Please note the price includes printing of 1000 invitations, catering on opening night (we have a license and sell wine, beer and champagne), staffing of the gallery, 
handling of sales (30% commission), email list of 10,000, display advertising in the art almanac and art gallery guide.

While the gallery is open 7 days a week 10am-10pm we do have life drawing on the top level Tues and Thu nights 6-30-9pm and Sat mornings 10-12 noon. 
During those hours Galleries 1 and 3 are not accessible to the public. But we think we more than make up for it by opening 12 hours  day, 7 days a week, which is a 
hell of a lot longer than any other gallery I know.

The following is a checklist of what you will need to do for the show.

1. Bring the work in at 10am on the day of the show for hanging. Please ensure the name of the work and hanging wire is on the back of each work.

2. Email an image (make it as large as possible so we may use it on the poster as well) and a title of the show for the invitations and advertising material asap but at
 least a 6 weeks before the show.

3. We include a entry in our display ad in the Art Almanac and Art Gallery Guide magazines as part of the gallery fee. However, we do extend to our artists two extra 
advertising opportunities. For $275 you can have a quarter page (as part of our full page ad) in the Australian Art Collector and for $350 you can have the full page 
part of our Art Almanac ad in the relevant month. A sample is attached of each. If you want to take up either of these opportunities let us know asap.

4. The week before the show email a price list as in the sample attached. Note there is one tab only between columns, NOT spaces. I will ensure it is lined up correctly 
and you will have a chance to proof it on the day of the hanging.

5. If you have an email list to send invitations to please email it to me and I will send them out from here.

6. You will get a proof of the invite and ads before they go to print. I will notify you when the printed invites are ready if you would like to pick some up for your own use.
 We print 1000 and you can have as many as you like of these. The rest we will distribute to cafes etc in our area.

7. Please note there the gallery does not cover the works with insurance. While we take every care with the work we are not responsible for any accidental damage,
 theft, fire or any other damage that may occur.

8. Please fill out the attached agreement, sign and email or post back asap.

9. You will need to collect any unsold work up after 4pm and before 6pm the day the show finishes.

Let me know if there is other information you need.
